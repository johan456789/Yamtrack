# Coding Agent Instructions

## Operating Principles

Keep it simple. Simple is better than complex.
Make the smallest maintainable change that solves the actual request.
Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions.
Avoid broad refactors, speculative helpers, and clever architecture unless clearly justified.
Do not build for hypothetical future use. Implement the current need cleanly and stop there.
Use judgment. Read enough surrounding code to understand the existing pattern, then avoid unnecessary exploration. Validate based on risk.
Assume the user is a principal engineer.
Optimize for correctness, speed, judgment, and token efficiency.
Correct the user when appropriate.

## Success Criteria

Done means:

- the requested behavior is implemented
- the change is minimal and follows existing patterns (Unless a large task was assigned)
- risky behavior was validated, or validation was intentionally skipped with a reason
- remaining risks are stated plainly

## Context Discipline

Protect context aggressively.

As tool output, file reads, and conversation history grow, useful signal gets diluted. Keep active context focused on the current decision.

Before opening files or running broad searches, ask:

1. What exact question am I answering?
2. Which file, symbol, route, or component is most likely relevant?
3. Can I inspect a narrower slice first?
4. Can `rg`, imports, references, or file names locate the answer?

Prefer targeted searches, focused file sections, nearby call sites, diffs, capped logs, and targeted test output.

Avoid dumping full files, full logs, unrelated directories, or broad repo exploration after the relevant code is found.

When context gets large, summarize the current task state and keep only:

- decisions
- relevant file paths
- changed behavior
- unresolved risks

## Subagents

Use subagents only when they save context, save time, or materially improve output quality.

For research, review, and exploration tasks, avoid confirmation bias. Do not pass a preferred conclusion. Ask the subagent to investigate, compare, or verify, and require evidence, tradeoffs, uncertainty, and better alternatives.

Good uses:

- repo exploration
- scoped implementation
- QA or review
- documentation/API checks
- web research
- unfamiliar code research
- copywriting/content variants

Avoid subagents for trivial work the main agent can finish faster.

When using a subagent, assign a narrow task and require:

- findings
- files inspected
- files changed, if any
- validation run, if any
- risks or uncertainty

The main agent owns final judgment and integration.

## Code Changes

Prefer direct edits using available environment tools like `apply_patch`

Before adding helpers, maps, files, abstractions, or validation layers, ask:

1. Can this be done inline?
2. Can existing code already do this?
3. Is this solving the exact issue?
4. Is reuse or readability clearly improved?

Do not create new abstractions, helper layers, provider interfaces, background tasks, docs, or config files unless the current task clearly needs them.
Before adding a new function, class, setting, management command, or integration hook, check whether an existing pattern already solves the same problem.

For bugs, patch the narrow failing path first.
For small behavior changes, make the direct edit first.
Avoid unrelated cleanup.

Split work into reviewable patches when possible:

- behavior change
- mechanical refactor
- tests
- docs

Do not mix these unless the user explicitly asks for a broad rewrite.

For complex tasks:

- identify the minimal path through the codebase
- split work into small patches
- validate only the risky parts
- keep a short running summary of decisions, changed files, and remaining risks

## Validation

Match validation to risk.

Skip validation by default for low-risk changes and say so plainly.

Never skip validation when touching:

- migrations
- models
- importers
- webhooks
- auth
- permissions
- settings
- Celery tasks or background jobs
- cache behavior
- persisted data
- external APIs
- upgrade paths
- any PR that spans more than one app boundary unless explicitly told not to validate

Low-risk examples:

- copy changes
- labels
- static content
- CSS or Tailwind spacing
- small JSX structure changes
- minor refactors with no behavior change

Also validate when:

- a previous command failed
- the user asked for validation
- the change affects multiple routes, components, or packages

Prefer targeted tests first (`scripts/test.sh <dotted.label>`), then `uv run --no-sync ruff check src`, then the fast suite (`scripts/test.sh`) only when risk justifies it. See the Testing section.

Prefer the cheapest useful check:

1. targeted test
2. type check affected package
3. lint affected files
4. build only when build behavior matters

Do not run a full test suite or full build unless risk justifies it or the user asks.

### Preexisting Failures (Baseline Zero Policy)

App tests, ruff, and lint were driven to zero as a dedicated cleanup effort. The expectation is to hold that baseline, not let it erode.

If you discover a test/ruff/lint failure while working on something unrelated:

1. Check it against baseline to confirm it's preexisting and not introduced by your change.
2. It's fine not to fix it inline as part of the current change.
3. Do not just silently note it — flag it explicitly to the user and state plainly that the expectation is to fix it, not just document it.
4. Prefer fixing it in a separate commit, and where practical a separate PR, so the cleanup is easy to review independently of the change at hand.

## Command Output

Protect context usage. **Any command with unknown or potentially large output must be byte-capped.**

Default pattern:

```bash
COMMAND 2>&1 | head -c 4000
```

For logs or recent failures:

```bash
COMMAND 2>&1 | tail -c 4000
```

Do not rely on line limits as the only cap. A single line can be huge. Avoid using only:

```bash
head -n
tail -n
sed -n '1,20p'
```

Scope before printing content:

- list files with `rg -l` before printing matches
- count matches with `rg -c` before reading them
- search specific paths instead of whole directories
- use `rg -m`, `--max-count`, `--max-filesize`, and small context when useful
- inspect file size before reading unknown generated files, logs, JSONL, or minified JSON

For commands where the exit code matters, capture output first, print a capped amount, then exit with the original status:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp)"
COMMAND >"$tmp" 2>&1
status=$?
tail -c 5000 "$tmp"
rm -f "$tmp"
exit "$status"
```

Avoid unbounded output from:

```bash
cat path/to/file
rg -n "term" .
find .
ls -R
git diff
npm test
npm run build
select *
```

Use bounded versions instead:

```bash
rg -l "term" . | head -c 2000
rg -n -m 20 "term" src 2>&1 | head -c 2000
git diff -- path/to/file 2>&1 | head -c 6000
find . -type f 2>&1 | head -c 2000
```

If the capped output is insufficient, narrow the command. Do not repeatedly increase the cap unless the task requires more context.

## Communication

Before editing, state the approach only for non-trivial tasks.

During complex work, keep updates very short:

- what was found
- what changed
- what risk remains

After work, summarize:

- what changed
- files touched
- validation run, or why skipped
- remaining risk

Keep summaries short. Do not explain obvious edits.

# Floppy Notes
Floppy is a Django 5.2 app for self-hosted media tracking with Celery workers and Redis. Tailwind CSS output is committed under `src/static/css/`, and templates load `src/static/css/main.css` via `src/templates/base.html`.

## Branch Policy
- `upstream` (formerly named `dev` in this fork) must be an exact mirror of `FuzzyGrim/Yamtrack:dev`. Never commit to it, target it with a PR, or add fork-only edits. Refresh it only by exact fast-forward/reset to the upstream remote.
- `latest` is the fork integration branch for day-to-day work and semantic upstream ports. Do not merge or rebase `upstream` into `latest`.
- `release` is for versioned release/container publication flow, not the primary integration branch.
- `latest` (dannyvfilms) and `release` remain upstream/remote integration and publication branches, not local working branches.

## Upstream Resolution Workflow

[`UPSTREAM_PORTS.md`](UPSTREAM_PORTS.md) is the durable source of truth. “Up to date” means zero unclassified upstream outcomes, not matching Git histories.

For each new outcome in `last-reviewed..upstream/dev`:

1. Record the canonical upstream commits and group related implementation, tests, migrations, and repairs.
2. Choose exactly one evidence-backed decision: Ported, Adapted, Superseded, Deferred, Discarded, or Pending with an owner issue.
3. Prefer a clean cherry-pick only for isolated changes whose paths and architecture still match. Otherwise implement the behaviour through Floppy's current public APIs and bounded contexts.
4. Preserve Floppy features, deployment paths, security/privacy, and user data. Dependency versions and generated assets are not upstream sources of truth.
5. Port useful regression cases even when the implementation is superseded or reimplemented.
6. For schema work, define final semantics first, audit existing data, and generate new Floppy migrations against the current graph. Never cherry-pick upstream migration files or reproduce an unsafe intermediate migration.
7. Update the ledger, owning issue, documentation, configuration examples, API schema/output, wiki, and upgrade guidance affected by the outcome.
8. Validate in proportion to risk using the repository's normal targeted, migration, database, container, and full-suite gates. Record actual evidence in the PR.

Models/migrations and divergent UI normally require manual adaptation. Provider modules and isolated importers may permit small ports. CI, Docker, and dependencies move as coherent platform packages. Branding, version bumps, merge commits, generated churn, and individual dependency-bot commits are normally discarded with the ledger's reason codes.

## Repository Map
- `src/` Django project code (apps: `app`, `users`, `lists`, `integrations`, `events`; config in `config/`).
- `src/templates/` and `src/static/` for UI templates and CSS assets.
- `src/static/css/main.css` is the committed Tailwind output loaded by templates.
- `src/db/` local SQLite artifacts.
- `docs/agents/` issue and workflow notes.
- `.github/workflows/` CI definitions.
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose*.yml`, `entrypoint.sh`, `nginx.conf`, `supervisord.conf` for container runtime.
- `wiki/` is a separate Git repository for the project wiki (edit and commit there, not in this repo).

## Workflow Notes
- Keep wiki pages in `wiki/` so they can be edited locally and pushed to the wiki repo.
- Treat `wiki/` as its own git repo (not a submodule); run commits/pushes from `wiki/`.
- Do not add `wiki/` to the main repo index; it should remain untracked here.
- Primary local development is source-run Django with Redis, Celery worker/beat, and Tailwind watcher.
- Secondary Docker usage is for deployment or quick smoke runs; the compose files use the prebuilt `ghcr.io/dannyvfilms/floppy` image.

## Agent Docs
- `docs/agents/media_type_integration.md`: playbook for adding new media types safely.
- `docs/agents/music_integration.md`: music-specific data model and UI integration notes.
- `docs/agents/pocketcasts_workflow.md`: Pocket Casts import/schedule workflow details.
- `docs/agents/migration_sync_playbook.md`: hard-gate flow for adapting accepted upstream migration outcomes to Floppy's current graph.

## Local Commands
- Install locked dev dependencies: `uv sync --locked`
- Run migrations: `uv run --no-sync python src/manage.py migrate`
- Run the app: `uv run --no-sync python src/manage.py runserver`
- Run Celery (two workers in one command, mirrors production):
  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=src uv run --no-sync celery -A config worker --queues interactive --hostname celery-interactive@%h --loglevel DEBUG &
  PYTHONPATH=src uv run --no-sync celery -A config worker --queues celery --beat --scheduler django --hostname celery@%h --loglevel DEBUG
  ```
  The interactive worker must be dedicated — **never add `celery` to its `--queues`** or long-running background tasks (Reload calendar, imports) will block user-triggered refreshes.
- Run Tailwind: `cd src && tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/main.css --watch`
- For local setup, see `README.md` for the required `.env` values and Redis startup details.

## Frontend Tooling
- Tailwind CLI install (supported): `brew install tailwindcss`.
- Alternatives: `npm/pnpm/yarn add -D tailwindcss` and run `npx tailwindcss ...`, or download the standalone Tailwind binary and add it to `PATH`.
- Note: `README.md` may reference output to `tailwind.css`; the supported committed output path is `src/static/css/main.css`.
- If a local watcher, shell alias, or editor task still writes `src/static/css/tailwind.css`, repoint it to `src/static/css/main.css`.

## Testing

Run tests through `scripts/test.sh`, in this priority order:

1. **Targeted (default while iterating):** `scripts/test.sh <dotted.label> [...]` — run only the tests for what you touched, e.g. `scripts/test.sh app.tests.views.test_media_details` or a whole app label like `scripts/test.sh lists`.
2. **Fast suite (default before finishing):** `scripts/test.sh` — the whole suite minus tests tagged `slow` (benchmarks and Playwright integration). Output is bounded (`--buffer` suppresses stdout of passing tests) and no `playwright install` is needed.
3. **Full suite (rarely needed locally):** `scripts/test.sh --full` — all tags, including slow benchmarks/Playwright and live-provider `network` tests. Takes 20+ minutes and produces huge output. Only run it when the user asks or the risk clearly justifies it. Application-impacting PRs run the CI application suite, which excludes `network` tests; documentation-only trigger filtering is owned by `.github/workflows/app-tests.yml`.

Notes:
- Quick confidence: `uv run --no-sync ruff check src`
- Migration sync confidence: `uv run --no-sync python src/manage.py check_migration_hygiene --strict`
- Migration upgrade replay: `scripts/replay_upgrade_matrix.sh --from-tag <previous_release_tag> --to-ref latest --db sqlite,postgres --with-drift-scenarios`
- Tag vocabulary: `slow` and `network` are the exclusion tags used by the fast
  suite. `network` marks tests that call a live provider API: they need keys and
  internet, they are slow and flaky, and a fork PR cannot read repository secrets,
  so CI excludes them. Run them with `scripts/test.sh --network`. If you add a test
  that needs a real provider response, either mock it or tag it.
- `slow` is the exclusion tag used by the fast suite; `benchmark` and `playwright` are sub-selectors (`scripts/test.sh --slow` runs only tagged tests). Any new benchmark/performance or Playwright test **must** be decorated with `@tag("slow", ...)`.
- `playwright install` is only needed when actually running Playwright-tagged tests (`scripts/test.sh --full` / `--slow`); the fast suite excludes them.
- `src/manage.py` sets `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.test_settings` for tests.
- `config.test_settings` uses fakeredis and sets `CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=True`.

## Style & Conventions
- Python target is 3.12 (see `Dockerfile` and CI).
- Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml` and excludes `migrations/`.
- Djlint config is in `pyproject.toml`; Stylelint config is in `.stylelintrc`.
- After model changes, keep migration files under `src/*/migrations/` and run `uv run --no-sync python src/manage.py migrate`.
- Media type changes follow `docs/agents/media_type_integration.md` (MediaTypes enum + `media_type_config` wiring).

## PR / Commit Expectations
- **Never commit unless the user explicitly asks.** Finishing a task, passing tests, or reaching a natural stopping point does not justify an automatic commit. Wait for a direct instruction such as "commit this", "commit the changes", or "make a commit".
- **Never amend a commit the user has not seen.** If a hook fails after a commit attempt, fix the issue and create a new commit — do not amend.
- CI fails PRs that modify `.github/workflows/**` (see `.github/workflows/app-tests.yml`).
- Large changes should be split into reviewable PRs or clearly justified if they cannot be.
- Review summaries should call out behavior changes, files touched, validation run, and remaining risk.
- Commit messages should use a short imperative title, then 1–3 bullet clarifications in the body. Optional issue lines: `Fixes #123` / `Refs #456`.

## Security / Safety Notes
- `.env` contains secrets and API keys; do not commit it.
- Docker entrypoint runs migrations and changes ownership inside the container (`entrypoint.sh`).
- Docker compose stores data in `./db`; local dev SQLite lives under `src/db/`.
